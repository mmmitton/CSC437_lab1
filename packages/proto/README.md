Choice of domain:

For this exercise, I chose to create a pokemon data base that will provide data 
on the first generation of pokemon. (The first 152). Originally I wanted to
do it for all pokemon, but after completing one page, I realized that I
definetly didn't want to make over 1,000 pages like this. So, we're going with the 
first 152.
