        <h2>Description: </h2>
        <p>
            Pallet Town is a fictional town in the Pokémon series and serves as 
            the player character's hometown in the Kanto region. It is the starting 
            point for Trainers embarking on their Pokémon journey in the first-generation 
            Pokémon games, including Pokémon Red, Blue, Green (Japan only), and Yellow. 
            
            <h3>Key features of Pallet Town include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Player's Home: </b>
                    Pallet Town is where the player character, often referred to as "the player" 
                    or "the protagonist," lives. The player's journey begins here, and they receive 
                    their first Pokémon from Professor Oak.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Professor Oak's Lab: </b>
                    Professor Oak, the Pokémon Professor of the Kanto region, has his research 
                    laboratory in Pallet Town. This is where players choose their Starter Pokémon 
                    and receive the Pokédex, a device used to record information about 
                    encountered Pokémon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Player Rival's Home:</b>
                    The player's main rival in the game, often referred to as "rival," also 
                    lives in Pallet Town. This character is a fellow Pokémon Trainer who will 
                    challenge the player at various points in the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Houses: </b>
                    Pallet Town consists of a few houses, including the player character's home, 
                    rival's home, and other residences. The town is relatively small compared 
                    to later cities in the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Lack of Pokémon Gym: </b>
                    Unlike most towns in the Pokémon world, Pallet Town does not have a Pokémon 
                    Gym. Trainers must leave Pallet Town and travel to other cities to challenge 
                    Pokémon Gyms and earn Gym Badges.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Pallet Town is significant in the Pokémon series as the starting location where players 
            receive their first Pokémon and set out on their journey to become a Pokémon Master. 
            It is a nostalgic and memorable location for fans of the original Pokémon games.
