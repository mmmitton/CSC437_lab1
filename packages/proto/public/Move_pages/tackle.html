            Tackle is a basic and commonly used Normal-type move in the Pokémon series. 
            It is a physical move that involves the Pokémon physically charging and 
            striking the opponent with force. Tackle has a base power of 40 and an 
            accuracy of 100%. It is one of the earliest moves that Pokémon usually learn 
            and is often considered a starting move for many Pokémon. Tackle is 
            straightforward and doesn't have any additional effects like status conditions 
            or stat changes. It is commonly used in the early stages of the game when 
            Pokémon have limited move options. As a basic move, Tackle is not known for 
            its high damage output, but it serves its purpose in the early battles of a 
            Pokémon's journey.
