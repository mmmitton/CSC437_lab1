    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>
        The Kanto region is the first and original Pokémon region introduced 
        in the Pokémon series. It serves as the setting for the first-generation 
        Pokémon games, including Pokémon Red, Blue, Green (Japan only), and Yellow. 
        Kanto is inspired by the real-world Kanto region in Japan and is known for 
        its diverse landscapes, cities, and Pokémon habitats.

                Elite Four.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Landscapes: </b>
                Kanto boasts a variety of landscapes, including forests, caves, 
                mountains, and bodies of water. Notable areas include Viridian Forest,

                <b>Legendary Pokémon: </b>
                Kanto is home to some iconic Legendary Pokémon, including Mewtwo 
                and the trio of Legendary Birds: Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres. Players 
                can encounter and attempt to capture these powerful Pokémon as part 
                of their journey.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Starters: </b>
                Kanto is where players first encounter the classic trio of Starter 
                Pokémon: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. These Pokémon are 
                offered to Trainers by Professor Oak at the beginning of their 
                journey.

                <b>Pokémon League: </b>
                The Pokémon League in Kanto is the ultimate goal for Trainers. 
                It consists of the Elite Four and the Champion. Trainers must 
                defeat all of them to become the Pokémon Champion.

        the starting point of the Pokémon journey and the foundation of the Pokémon 
        series. It has been revisited in various games, anime episodes, and spin-off 
        media throughout the years.
