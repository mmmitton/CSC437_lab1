            Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version were the first Pokémon games to be 
            released outside of Japan, becoming available in North America on September 28, 
            1998, in Australia and New Zealand on October 23, 1998 and in Europe on October 5, 
            1999.In North America, the pair closely followed the debut of the anime's English dub, 
            which began airing on September 8, 1998, and within a year, Pokémon was well known 
            as a popular Nintendo franchise.The games were available on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual 
            Console between the Pokémon 20th Anniversary on February 27, 2016 and the discontinuation 
            of the 3DS Nintendo eShop on March 27, 2023. Unlike later generations, Red and Blue 
            were not the same as their corresponding Japanese releases Pokémon Red and Green. Besides 
            Pokémon distribution, the aspects of Red and Blue such as graphics, script, and sprite 
            designs are instead based on the Japanese Pokémon Blue. Despite being released towards
            the end of Game Boy's lifespan, they quickly became the best-selling non-bundled games 
            released for the Game Boy as well as being the best-selling role-playing games of all 
            time when also including sales of Pokémon Green and the Japanese versions of Pokémon Red 
            and Blue. Sales exceed 31 million units for all versions combined, which made them the 
            best selling Pokémon games and the only games in the series to exceed 30 million units.

            The plot of Pokémon Red and Blue follows the journey of the player character, a Pokémon 
            Trainer, as they strive to become the Pokémon Champion. The overarching storyline involves 
            the player's encounters with various Pokémon, Gym Leaders, and the villainous Team Rocket. 
            
            <h3 id = plot_overview>Here is a brief overview of the plot:</h3>

                    Gym Leaders in different cities to earn Gym Badges. Each Gym specializes in a 
                    specific type of Pokémon, and winning badges is necessary for entering the 
                    Pokémon League.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Along the way, the player encounters Team Rocket, a criminal organization led 
                    by Giovanni. Team Rocket is involved in illegal activities related to Pokémon, 
                    and the player must thwart their plans at various points in the game.

      <h2>Features: </h2>
      <hr>
        <h3>Gyms: </h3>
        <p>
            Players are introduced to the first eight Pokémon Gyms of the series, 
            each with their own type affiliation, led by Brock (Rock), Misty (Water), 
            Lt. Surge (Electric), Erika (Grass), Koga (Poison), Sabrina (Psychic), 
            Blaine (Fire) and Giovanni (Ground).
        </p>
        <h3>Elite Four:</h4>
        <p>
            The Elite Four of Kanto are a step above the rest, all located at Indigo 
            Plateau and ready to take on all challengers. In order, they are Lorelei (Ice), 
            Bruno (Fighting), Agatha (Ghost) and Lance (Dragon). The final battle is against 
            the Pokémon Champion, the rival, who does not have a type specialization.
        </p>
        <h3>Pokemon:</h3>
        <p>
            Each game contains pre-recorded data on 151 different species of Pokémon, including Mew, 
            a Pokémon unavailable to players of either game under normal conditions. Despite this, 
            not all Pokémon are available to the player, regardless of version; trades must occur 
            between players in order to complete their Pokédex without the use of cheats or glitches. 
            Mew is the only Pokémon in these games that must be acquired through attending either a 
            Nintendo sponsored event, a glitch, or cheating.
