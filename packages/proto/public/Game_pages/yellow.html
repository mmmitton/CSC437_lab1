            Pokémon Yellow Version: Special Pikachu Edition, often known as Pokémon 
            Yellow Version, is the third Pokémon game for Game Boy released worldwide, 
            as a solitary version of Pokémon Red and Blue Versions. In Japan, the game 
            was the fourth Pokémon game released, as a second solitary version of Pocket 
            Monsters Red & Green. Unlike other games, Pokémon Yellow was inspired by the anime. 
            Similar to Red and Blue, Yellow arrived towards the end of the Game Boy's lifespan. 
            It managed, though, to receive the title of second best-selling non-bundled game 
            for its console, losing only to its predecessors. The game was available on the 
            Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console between the Pokémon 20th Anniversary on February 27, 
            2016 and the discontinuation of the 3DS Nintendo eShop on March 27, 2023. Generation 
            VII remakes, titled Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, were released 
            worldwide for the Nintendo Switch in November 2018, in celebration of Yellow's 20th 
            anniversary in Japan.

        <h2 id = plot>Plot:</h2>
        <p>
            "Pokémon Yellow" follows a similar plot to 
            <a href = ".\red_blue.html">"Pokémon Red" and "Pokémon Blue"</a> 
            but with some notable differences. In Pokémon Yellow, the storyline 
            is influenced by the Pokémon animated TV series and features a more 
            direct connection with the show. 

            <h3 id = plot_overview>Here's an overview of the plot:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Pikachu as the Starter Pokémon: </b>
                    In Pokémon Yellow, the player starts their journey not with 
                    a choice of Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle, but with Pikachu. 
                    Pikachu becomes the player's constant companion and follows them 
                    outside of its Poké Ball.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Influence from the TV Series: </b>
                    The game incorporates elements from the Pokémon animated TV series. 
                    Jessie, James, and Meowth of Team Rocket make appearances, and the 
                    player's Pikachu has unique interactions and expressions that reflect 
                    its personality in the show.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Rival and Team Rocket: </b>
                    The player still has a rival, but this character is more closely modeled 
                    after Gary Oak from the TV series. Team Rocket's involvement in illegal 
                    Pokémon activities remains a central part of the plot, with encounters 
                    and battles against Team Rocket members throughout the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Addition of Jessie, James, and Meowth: </b>
                    The iconic Team Rocket trio from the TV series, Jessie, James, and Meowth, 
                    play a more prominent role. Players encounter them multiple times, adding 
                    a comedic and recognizable element to the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Special Pikachu Events: </b>
                    Pikachu's reactions and expressions in Pokémon Yellow are influenced by 
                    its mood, which can be affected by events in the game. For example, 
                    Pikachu may become unhappy if the player neglects or faints too often 
                    in battles. These interactions enhance the bond between the player 
                    and Pikachu.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Surfing Pikachu: </b>
                    In Pokémon Yellow, players have the opportunity to teach Pikachu the 
                    move Surf, allowing it to participate in battles more effectively. 
                    This adds a unique gameplay aspect not present in Pokémon Red and Blue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Post-Elite Four Content: </b>
                    After defeating the Pokémon League, players can explore the new post-Elite 
                    Four content, including a battle against Jessie and James in the Viridian 
                    City Pokémon Center.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Cerulean Cave: </b>
                    Like in Pokémon Red and Blue, Cerulean Cave is the location where players 
                    can encounter and attempt to capture the powerful Psychic-type Pokémon, Mewtwo.
